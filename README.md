#Alien_Invasion  
  
I installed pygame  
`python -m pip install pygame`  
I did need to create a venv in VSCode because I have multiple versions of python or something I don't understand.
  
- in pygame a surface is a part of the screen that you can draw on  
- an event is an action that the user does like pressing a key or moving the mouse  
- an event loop is a loop that listens for events and responds to them  
    - The speed of the game is controlled by the speed of the loop.   
    - to control a consistent frame rate, you can use the clock object in pygame
